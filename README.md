# Discretization Methods for Geometric Brownian Motion

This repository contains Python implementations of the Euler and Milstein discretization methods for simulating paths of geometric Brownian motion (GBM), which is commonly used in financial mathematics to model asset prices.

## Methods

### Euler Discretization

The Euler method is a simple numerical method for approximating solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

### Milstein Discretization

The Milstein method is an extension of the Euler method that includes an additional term to account for the variation in the diffusion term of the SDE.

## Installation

Provide instructions for installing any necessary Python packages.

## Usage

Example command-line instructions for running the script:

```bash
python discretization_methods.py
